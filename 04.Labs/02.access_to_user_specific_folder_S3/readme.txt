This policy is used to grant IAM users access to the same Amazon S3 bucket so that they can use the AWS Management Console to store their information. All users will be able to upload or download files from their own folders, but they will not be able to access anyone else’s folder in the bucket.

I’ve already created a bucket named my-company with the following structure:

/home/Adele/
/home/Bob/
/home/David/
/restricted/
/root-file.txt
